<h1>About Galardex</h1>
<p>In the entire Pokémon game, there are eight different playing regions. The Galar region has its own specific Pokédex which contains all the Pokémon available within the region. It is the eighth generation of Pokédex settings. At present there is no sign of how large the Galar Region is, but in this visualization we have used the traditional Galar Region map to plot our points. There are currently 400 individual Pokédex in the region. Each identified by one or two of the 18 different types (ex: Fire, Grass, Fairy, Poison). All of which are visible on our Galar map.</p>

<h2>Findings</h2>
<p>Using this data visualization we were able to discover specific regions within the Pokemon world where the individual pokemon were spawning more and less frequently. When looking at the map, you can easily notice the different densities of Pokemon in each respective region. When looking at the Sort and Filter section, you can easily look at a certain location or a specific type of Pokemon. We found some of the locations with the highest Pokemon spawning density are Dusty Bowl and Lake of Outrage. On the other hand, one of the least populated Pokemon regions is Hilbury and Motostoke.</p>
<p>We hope this data visualization brings you as much entertainment as it does for the creators. Please, explore and further discover the world of Pokemon!</p>

<h2>How to Use the Visualization</h2>
<p>
This visualization is used to find pokemon in the Galar region.
Using the sort and filter tools on the left side of the screen you are able to sort and filter through the various pokemon found in the Galar Region. 
The Name section is used to type the name of the pokemon you are looking for.
Type 1 and Type 2 are drop down menus used to delineate the type of pokemon you are looking for if you do not know the name.
Location is also a drop down menu, however this shows along which route you are more likely to find a pokemon
Generation is used to note when the pokemon was created. Generation 1 is the early stages in pokemon whereas generation 8 is the more recent stages.
HP is used as a sliding bar to show the Hit Points of the pokemon you are looking for in the Galar region. The hit points of a pokemon are the amount of power a particular pokemon has when going into a fight. A pokemon with a larger HP has a greater chance of winning a batter than a pokemon with a lower HP
Spawn Chance is also a sliding bar showing the probability of spawning in a specific location on the map. The closer the pokemon is to 100% the more likely you are to find the particular pokemon in the Galar region along their route.
