            <h1>How It Works</h1>
            <img src="Demo.gif" width="100%">
            <div class="secondary-section">
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 1em;">Filter</h3>
                <p>Using the panel on the left side of the screen you are able to filter through the various
                    Pok&eacutemon
                    found
                    in the Galar Region. </p>
                <div class="secondary-section">
                    <p>The <em>Name</em> filter can be used to search for a specific Pok&eacutemon by name.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <em>Type 1</em> and <em>Type 2</em> selectors allow you to filter by the Pok&eacutemon's
                        primary
                        and secondary types.</p>
                    <p>The <em>Location</em> filter will let you filter to Pok&eacutemon that spawn in a specific area
                        of the Galar
                        region.
                        When using this filter the map will only show the dots (spawn locations) of Pok&eacutemon within
                        the
                        region, despite the fact that the Pok&eacutemon that spawn there may also spawn in other
                        regions. </p>
                    <p>The <em>Generation</em> filter will allow you to filter by the generation in which that
                        Pok&eacutemon
                        was
                        introduced. </p>
                    <p>The <em>HP</em> slider lets you filter the list to only show Pok&eacutemon whose HP (health) is
                        within
                        the given
                        bounds. </p>
                    <p>The <em>Spawn Chance</em> slider lets you filter to only show Pok&eacutemon that have a chance of
                        spawning within
                        the bounds. Similarly to the location filter, the map will only show the specific dots that
                        spawn
                        within the restrictions even if that Pok&eacutemon spawns elsewhere on the map at a different
                        chance.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 1em;">Search</h3>
                <p>The middle of the visualization is a large table that lists out all of the Pok&eacutemon that meet
                    the
                    given filter requirements.</p>
                <p>Clicking on one of the rows will change the left section from the filter
                    panel to an in-depth Pok&eacutemon details panel where you can find out about the stats of the
                    Pok&eacutemon.
                </p>
                <p>Additionally, selecting a Pok&eacutemon will filter the map panel to only show the dots that
                    correspond
                    with that Pok&eacutemon. </p>
                <h3 style="font-size: 1.5em; margin-top: 1em;">Explore</h3>
                <p>The right panel is a map of the Galar Region with the dots representing a Pok&eacutemon spawn
                    location.
                </p>
                <p>Dots are colored according to the primary type of the Pok&eacutemon, and hovering on a dot allows you
                    to
                    see more information about the Pok&eacutemon it represents.</p>
                <p>Similarly to the table, clicking on a dot will
                    select the Pok&eacutemon, open up the details panel, and filter the map dots. </p>

            <h2>Interesting Findings</h2>
            <p>Using this data visualization we were able to discover specific regions within the Pok&eacutemon world
                where
                the individual pokemon were spawning more and less frequently. When looking at the map, you can easily
                notice the different densities of Pok&eacutemon in each respective region. Using the <em>Filter</em>
                section,
                you can
                easily get a closer look at a certain location or a specific type of Pok&eacutemon. </p>
            <p>We found that some of the locations with the highest pokemon spawning density are Dusty Bowl and Lake of
                Outrage. On the other hand, some of the least populated pokemon areas are Hilbury and Motostoke. </p>
            <p>We hope this data visualization brings you as much entertainment as it does for us. Please, explore and
                further discover the world of Pok&eacutemon! </p>
